# To run locally:

- clone repository
- change axios instance in api.js to localhost:8080 (notes in file)
- ensure that you have node, docker, and yarn globally installed on machine
- ensure that there are no services running on localhost:3000
- in terminal run docker-compose up -d . This will build and run a docker container that is accessible in the browser at localhost:3000
- start up api (see readme on loanprobe)
